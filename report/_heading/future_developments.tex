\section{Future Developments}

While this assignment has provided valuable insights into Transformer-based models and fine-tuning techniques, there are several areas for further exploration and improvement. Future work could include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Expanding the scope of fine-tuning techniques}: Investigating additional techniques such as BitFit, Prefix Tuning, and QLoRA for enhanced efficiency.
    \item \textbf{Evaluating LLM performance on specialized domains}: Fine-tuning models for domain-specific tasks (e.g., medical, legal, and financial NLP applications).
    \item \textbf{Enhancing computational efficiency}: Exploring quantization and pruning methods to reduce model size and improve inference speed.
    \item \textbf{Investigating ethical considerations}: Addressing concerns such as bias in LLMs and ensuring fair and responsible AI deployment.
    \item \textbf{Deploying models in real-world scenarios}: Implementing LLMs in production environments and assessing their practical impact.
\end{itemize}

By continuing our research in these areas, we aim to contribute to the ongoing advancements in Natural Language Processing and the efficient utilization of Large Language Models.
